# Bluemix Object Storage application

This sample application illustrates the usage of the OpenStack Swift Object Storage service by an application deployed to the IBM Bluemix Platform-as-a-Service.


## Steps

Follow these steps to set up a Bluemix account, provision an instance of the Swift Object Storage, and deploy a Node.js application that provides a user interface for uploading and sharing files.

* Sign up for IBM Bluemix

* Create an instance of the Object Store service through the Bluemix catalog UI (v1, not v2). Name the service 'object-store' so that it matches the manifest file and leave it unbound.

* Sign up for the IBM DevOps service

* Fork the nodejs-object-storeage repository to get the application code (public project, uncheck scrum features, create Bluemix project)

* Deploy the application to Bluemix

* Access the application via the URL to upload / view / delete any text, image, and PDF files
